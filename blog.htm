          <h3>HTML Shenanigans and Starting Site Design</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Tuesday, May 22 2018</h4>
          <p>Today I accepted a generous offer to work at Northwestern University for the summer. Working there last summer, I would be continuing what I did previously, but this time I want to be more software focused instead of networking. Since iCAIR is completely focused on networking, I am not quite sure how this is going to work, but for now I just want to get a site up and running that looks decent. Obviously it doesn't right now because it is literally just HTML. As of now, I'm still learning about the sectioning elements of HTML, such as "section", "aside", "div", and "article". WAI ARIA roles are used to make sites more accessible by using more specific "roles" than just the HTML5 tags. They allow more verbose scanning for anything parsing your site! These roles are way too many to remember, so they can be found on the following site: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance/" title="Wai-Aria roles table" target="_blank">Wai-aria roles table</a>. Likewise, here is a link to a reference table for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/default.asp" title="tag reference" target="_blank">HTML tags.</a> Just for good measure, here's another reference on general <a href="HTML_syntax.pdf" title="HTML syntax reference" target="_blank">HTML syntax</a>.</p>
          <p>Today is also the first day of starting work on my website. Originally I planned to try to start learning some CSS before making the site, but why not just start figuring out the structure? Oh boy, here it goes.</p>
          <p>Here is what my site looked like at the end of <a href="day1.PNG" title="Day One Site">day one</a>.

          <h3>Some Basic CSS</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Wednesday, May 23 2018</h4>
          <p>Today is all about making the site look a little better. My plans currently are: Sliding side bar navigation, some sort of outline for each blog post "section", and making the site look nicer in general. The sliding sidebar may have been too ambitious of an undertaking given that it has to be done in JavaScript, so I'll move the navigation to the top for now. I am pretty happy with how the top navigation bar looks for now, because I think this is about as good as I can get it without knowing any JavaScript and not being experienced with design.</p>
          <p>I also added a favicon, which is a small touch but a nice one in my opinion</p>

          <h3>A little more CSS and <i>Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition</i></h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Thursday, May 24 2018</h4>
          <p>So today I didn't do too much to the website. I just made the links appear in bearable colors, and now when you hover over the links at the top, the colors become inverted from the normal color scheme. The layout of the site hasn't changed, and I still have to figure out what to do to the home page. But, that is something I'll have to leave for another day because I can't think of a good solution. I might also reverse the order of the blog so that it's the most recent on top. Here's what the blog looks like at the end of <a href="day3.PNG" title="day three design">day three</a>. Since I am pretty much done with the site editing, I think that tomorrow I'll find a free way to host this site. I've heard about heroku, but I have no idea how it works.</p>
          <p>I decided to learn a little bit about python, because that seems to be the language that everyone is doing data mining and machine learning with. Also, last year at iCAIR I worked with a little bit of Python, so it can't hurt to get a better understanding of it. <i>Python Cookbook</i> seems to be one of the highest recommended books for learning python, so I decided to try to read it. So far, it assumes that I know more than I do know, so I may have to switch to a more beginner friendly python book, but I'll try to get through some more of this one first. It starts off with some simple data structure information, so each section I read, I also test out the functions that the book goes over by making small and simple python files that I can run quickly.</p>
